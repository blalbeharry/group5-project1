* User Story: The user would be any and all music enthusiasts. Our app helps the user pick a song to listen to that aligns with their mood. With their selection of "mood", we would generate a randomized song from a matrix of songs that range across genres and display a visualization, as well as information about the song and artist. This would bridge the gap between genres, introduce users to new music, and especially create an ambient environment that reflects the user's emotions.
* Potential API's: Genius (lyrics or information) and Spotify (music snippets).
